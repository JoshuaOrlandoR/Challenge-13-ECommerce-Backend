  ## Description
  Internet retail, or E-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry. This application serves to both aid my own understanding in working with object-relational mapping, but also to build something that could be useful to the e-commerce industry.  

  ## Requirements
  This application is powered by JavaScript, and requires the use of Node, Sequelize, Mysql2, Express, and a tool to test RESTful applications, int his case, Insomnia.

  ## Installation
  To Install the Application: Download the Repository and open the folder in a coding enviornment, such as Visual Studio Code. Open an integrated terminal and type (without the quotation marks) "npm i", this will install all required dependencies. 

  ## Useage
  To utilize the app, users must set up MySQL, and require valid login information to do so. If there any questions on how to get this information, follow MySQLs documentation.
  
  In the integrated terminal, type "mysql -u root -p". When prompted for a password, please enter it.

  Next, type "source db/schema.sql". If there are no errors, type "quit" to exit the mysql shell. 
  
  Now type "npm run seed" and "npm start". This will launch the application on localhost port 3001. There is no actual application users can utilize directly on this port, instead, a program like POSTman or Insomnia will allow users to see if their backend is set up correctly. 
  
  Examples of this will be displayed in the walkthrough video and GIFs in the Tests section.
